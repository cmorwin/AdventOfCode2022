# Core Files

Challenge 1: Find the start-of-packet marker, which is 4 consecutive, unique characters

`>python3 challenge1.py`

Challenge 2: Find the start-of-message marker, which is 14 consecutive, unique characters

`>python3 challenge2.py`

# Assumptions:

`input.txt` for the day's challenges are in the current directory.

# Additional Files:

`support.py` - contains common support functions like reading files & timing functions

# Hilarity

The difference between `challenge1.py` and `challenge2.py` is literally 1 character. The way I coded the first challenge literally played perfectly into the second. (And I totally wanted to overthink it and try for fancy optimizations)
